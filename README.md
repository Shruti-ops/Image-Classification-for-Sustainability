# ♻️ Recyclable Material Classification with CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project classifies garbage images into categories like **paper, plastic, metal, glass, etc.** using a CNN model. It supports sustainability by aiding in automated waste sorting.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📦 Dataset
Kaggle Dataset: [Garbage Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification)

## 🧪 Model Summary
- 3 Convolutional Layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Trained on ~2000 images
- Achieved ~XX% validation accuracy

## 📊 Results
- Confusion matrix to evaluate class-wise performance
- Live predictions on uploaded test images

## 🚀 Future Work
- Add more data for better generalization
- Try Transfer Learning (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet)
- Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit
